‚ÄúHave you ever wished to ask an AI agent questions about selected thousands of pages after you have woken up from a good sleep?‚Äù üôÇ <br>
I wrote the blog ‚ÄúHello, world! your crafted chat GPT bot!‚Äù ‚Äùhttps://blogs.sap.com/2023/04/19/hello-world-your-crafted-chat-gpt-bot/ about how to use OpenAI API to submit completions and ask further questions. The questions are restricted to the content the OpenAI was trained and that is not always enough as we want to extend the capabilities with actual online-specific content or local content.
Asking questions from additional content requires data augmentation. Let‚Äôs see what is possible nowadays with OpenAI API and LlamaIndex.
