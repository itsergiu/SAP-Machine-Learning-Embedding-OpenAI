“I quit!” – How to predict employee churn | SAP HANA Cloud Machine Learning Challenge [Submission closed]

Companies want to prevent their highly skilled employees from leaving the company. Today, many of them rely on their managers’ intuition to foresee employee churn. However, this method is neither precise nor unbiased.
Think about how some managers say that their best guess for a high churn probability is an employee’s new haircut. A new haircut might indicate that a person is ready for more important changes. However, could we really deduce this from one factor?
By looking at concrete data and analyzing complex patterns, we can better make effective business decisions. There are people who would argue that human behavior is too complex to be reflected in datasets. However, we don’t favor one approach over the other. Instead, we are suggesting using both subjective information (such as the opinion of a manager) and the analytical and mathematical conclusions from the data to discover new insights.
Consider this when analyzing employee churn:
A high churn rate among new hires could indicate that the onboarding process needs to be improved and thus leads to a reflection of the company culture and a change in the treatment of new hires.
We could also take a closer look at internal employee turnover and their success rate or make better learning recommendations based on data.
Further, data could be used to help reflect on whether we are leveraging the full potential of our most experienced colleagues.
Understand our challenge
Watch the recording of our kick-off call
The purpose of the challenge is to give participants some hands-on experience on how the Machine Learning embedded in SAP HANA Cloud and SAP Data Warehouse Cloud can be utilized. IT experts can experiment with Machine Learning with the support of a global team of experts, ready to support in different time zones and seasoned Data Scientists can participate to become familiar with SAP’s components for Machine Learning on structured data.
To win the challenge, you will need to come up with a clever implementation of the use case with SAP HANA Machine Learning​ and an appealing presentation delivering a clear message that matches your persona and use case. We are NOT just looking for the highest accuracy, precision or recall but also a catchy presentation, or a solid story.​
