Dear SAP Community, 
We are excited to invite you to the kick-off call for our next SAP Community challenge: “I quit!” – How to prevent employee churn! After having discovered the graph world last time, we are more than excited to dive deeper into the world of machine learning in SAP HANA Cloud this time. 
What: “I quit!” – How to prevent employee churn | SAP HANA Cloud Machine Learning Challenge 
When: November 28, 11am EST / 5pm CET 
Duration: 1 hour (presentation + Community challenge kick-off + Q&A) 
SAP HANA Cloud offers a comprehensive, natively embedded set of machine learning capabilities and interfaces, allowing you to develop smart applications and to analyze sensitive data while ensuring privacy. Within SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA database you get two machine learning libraries: The Predictive Analysis Library (PAL) and the Automated Predictive Library (APL). Targeting data scientists, that are leveraging SAP HANA Cloud’s native machine learning capabilities, there are Python and R machine learning client packages available. This truly simplifies moving from an open-source scenario to embedded machine learning in SAP HANA Cloud. 
In our SAP community call, we will provide you with an overview of the embedded machine learning capabilities in SAP HANA Cloud. This includes the Predictive Analysis Library (PAL) for the machine learning expert and a more automated approach through the Automated Predictive Library (APL). You will for example learn how you can stay in your favorite Python environment and create machine learning models without extracting data into your local environment. Finally, we are excited to kick-off our SAP HANA Cloud Machine Learning challenge, that will be hosted in cooperation with our SAP Machine Learning Experts.  
Don’t worry, in case you cannot attend the call, we will also publish a dedicated blogpost describing the challenge. Stay tuned for a blogpost on the prerequisites that will be published in the next couple of days.  
So, if you are interested in SAP HANA Cloud’s natively embedded Machine Learning capabilities and want to get hands-on experience with them, this call will be a great fit for you. Join our experts Christoph Morgen, Yannick Schaper, Sarah Detzler, and Andreas Forster to dive deep into the topic of machine learning in SAP HANA Cloud. 
Register now!
In case you cannot attend the call, don’t worry, we are live streaming on YouTube and the recording will be available right afterwards for you to re-watch and share with others that might also be interested in the contents presented. We will also include the link to the recording on the SAP HANA on-premises and cloud databases Community Page afterwards, as well as a dedicated blog post explaining the SAP HANA Cloud Machine Learning Challenge in detail.  
Do you already have questions? Feel free to post them in the comment section below this blogpost. Also, feel free to tag your colleagues that should join this call together with you.

Hi Susen. I am a full stack SAP BW developer and I learned and understood what machine learning is by experimenting on Kaggle. Reading is not sufficient you have to work with data and code. Kaggle provides the playground with knowledge projects, competitions and shared working codes. How can I get such an environment on SAP HANA cloud? Regards. Sergey.

I speak English. I found in blogs official documentation for the components.
SAP HANA Python Client API for Machine Learning Algorithms
SAP HANA Predictive Analysis Library (PAL)
Documentation comes along with statistics used in processing. Statistics for developers is to understand how it works and insert some enhancements, but the focus should be on end-to-end project implementations. If a problem can be solved with an AutoML probably there is a chance for fine tuning by exploring other libraries. To improve something in the first place, you need something that works.

A BW specific end-2-end implementation blog would be SAP HANA Machine Learning with ABAP Managed Database Procedures in SAP BW/4HANA | SAP Blogs
